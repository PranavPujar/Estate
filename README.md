# **Syndicate**
Connect Developers and Investors to build Real Estate

## _Profile Creation_
 
**Developers/Syndicators**: When developers and syndicators join the app, they create profiles with details about their real estate projects. This includes property descriptions, location, project scope, and uploaded documents like permits and cost schedules.
 
**Investors**: Investors set up profiles with their investment preferences. They specify the types of properties they are interested in, such as residential, commercial, or industrial, along with investment size and location preferences.

## _Document Upload_
 
**Developers/Syndicators**: Developers and syndicators can upload relevant documents related to their real estate projects. These documents may include property permits, architectural plans, financial projections, location details and more.
 
**Investor Access**: Investors can access these uploaded documents when they match with developers or syndicators. This allows them to review project details and make informed investment decisions.

## _Matching_
 
**Matching Algorithm**: The app employs a matching algorithm similar to Tinder's swiping mechanism. Developers, syndicators, and investors can browse profiles and swipe right (like) or left (dislike) on profiles that align with their interests.
 
**Mutual Matches**: Investors swipe on Developers first. Developers then get to choose which investors they want to choose. When two users swipe right on each other's profiles, it's considered a "match." This mutual interest initiates a connection between them, and the two entities can communicate with each other. 
 
## _Communication_
 
**In-App Messaging**: Once a match is established, users can communicate with each other through an in-app messaging system. This feature enables them to discuss potential real estate projects, investment opportunities, and collaboration details.
 
**Secure and Private**: Conversations are secure and private, ensuring that sensitive information remains confidential.
